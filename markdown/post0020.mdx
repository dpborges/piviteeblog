We all need help from time to time, but what’s the best way to reach out to others?

Phone calls, texts and emails are all fine, but communicating back and forth with everyone  involved is not the most 
productive way to collaborate with  people these days. With all our busy 
schedules, it’s difficult to carve out time out of our day for ourseleves, never mind adding another 
layer of phone calls, emails and texts, on top of the ones we already get. So what is an efficient way to seek help?                                                    

One solution is to use a task sharing app like the [Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com).

Many party and event planners have benefited from the useful nature of this app, which allows them to keep 
track of critical tasks. Access to these tools makes it easy to 
ensure all details are accounted for as well as the people responsible for making them happen.

Just create a “Helpings Hands” list, which is effectively a shared to do list or shared task list. 
Then, everyone given access to the list  can volunteer for any task they feel comfortable with. The other way to get people involved is via the 
“Contribution List”. Instead of volunteering for a task,  people can contribute food or certain items, to help in the 
overall effort.

Part of the appeal of putting together a team of helpers using the Pitch In Club app is that it’s simple to share the same 
list of needs and roles, and then use the “help sign up” to get others involved. This makes it much easier than one 
person having to juggle everything.

Getting started with a group planning effort is easy: Just create a helping Hands list and a Contributions list 
and share away. This can benefit people who want to help but don’t know where to start, or for people who want to 
help, but don’t necessarily know the recipient well enough to personally approach them.

Overall, the [Pitch In Club App](https://pitchinclub.com)
is a useful resource that utilizes the shared task list or shared to do list concept 
to organize an event, activity, or any group effort you have in mind, and its stepwise process makes it simple to use.
You may want to consider it next time you plan your next event.
Remember, a little help goes a long way, and a shared task list is the best way to get it done.
