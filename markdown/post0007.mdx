[63 million Americans](https://nonprofitssource.com/online-giving-statistics/volunteering-statistics/)
are ready to volunteer their time for your next event. History shows that no matter what—in times of 
recession or booming success—there's no lack of human kindness. Volunteers are invaluable to event 
planners because they're ready to assist you

That said, strong volunteer event planning requires organization. Having free hands with no 
direction can cause more chaos.

## Volunteer Event Planning

Strong volunteer event planning means using your volunteers! Have a job for everyone. Before you reach out, it's 
good to get clear about the event you're organizing. Ask yourself: 


- What kind of event is this?
- What kinds of resources will I need? Food? Supplies?
- How much money is required? 
- How big's the event?
- How many volunteers could I use and for how long?
- When is it?

The more information you can give your volunteers, the better, so they know what they're signing up for. 

Planning a volunteer event means *you're the planner*. Not having these details can make for a confused team.

## Event Planning Volunteer Checklist

Once you have an idea of your next event, it's best to prepare two lists. One's for the event details, and the other's 
for you regarding how to manage your volunteers. 

## 1. Get to Know Your Team

Volunteers are 
[dynamic and passionate people!](https://www.volunteermatch.org/volunteers/resources/tipstricks.jsp)
Knowing their strengths and weaknesses can help you strategize. Connecting also makes it easy for 
volunteers to want to help!

## 2. Have Sign-Up Sheets

You can either assign duties or have sign-up sheets for people to choose their 
duties and time slots. Giving some freedom to your volunteers keeps folks happy and collaborative.

## 3. Give Rewards for Helping

If your response rate is low, incentives can keep people focused and committed. Offering gift cards, a raffle, 
or a community pot-luck is a nice way to motivate the team and keep morale high.

## 4. Expect the Unexpected

It's best for event planning volunteers to be briefed before, during, and after the event. Like a pre-game, intermission, 
or post-game sports talk, your team should know what to expect. Good events have flowing communication, camaraderie, 
and connection.

## 5. Keep in Touch

The worst thing would be not acknowledging or thanking your volunteers for their time and effort. Successful 
events take a village, and volunteers are that village. Making an impression on your volunteers fuels their passion to help.
Make people feel valued and they'll keep coming back for future events!
