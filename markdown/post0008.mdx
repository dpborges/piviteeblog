## What is a Watch Party?

A watch party is just that. It’s an assembly of you and your friends or family where you sit 
down and watch something. You can watch anything from your favorite television shows down to 
the next Mars rover launch this summer. At its core, a watch party is a great way to connect 
with the people you love most. Not only do you get to hang out with them for the night, but you have something you can talk about during the event and well after. Between theory crafting and insane reactions, this night will definitely be for the books.

## What Are You Watching?

As the host of the watch party, you are in charge and responsible for almost everything. What 
your group is going to be watching is one of them… sort of.  While you definitely have a large 
say in what your group watches, it should be open to the rest of the group. If you organize a 
watch party with content that nobody wants to see, then it’s going to flop. To avoid this, 
opening up the floor for input and suggestions from your friends can let you know where their 
heads are at. If you and your friends have a television show or a series of movies that you all 
watch together, then this part is basically done. Just make sure with them that they’re down to 
binge the season or trilogy.

## Invites and Headcounts

Now it’s time to start inviting people to your watch party. Are you keeping it small and intimate, 
inviting only your group of friends? Maybe you’ll branch out a little and invite some new friends 
into the mix. Once you’ve sent out invites, try to scout out who is planning to attend your watch 
party. This headcount will give you a better idea of specifics for your party like seating and food.

## Food and Beverage

What is your foodstuff situation? Well, it depends on what kind of watch party you're having.
If you’re having a Game of Thrones watch party or a Stranger Things watch party, maybe you’ll 
just load up on [snacks and drinks](https://www.foodandwine.com/holidays-events/viewing-party-recipes)

it may be better to have a potluck style watch party. Have everyone make a dish and bring it to your 
house.
