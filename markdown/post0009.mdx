## Create a Monthly Calendar

You'll want to create a monthly calendar so that you and your church members can ensure that you've got 
everything prepared before the event takes place. A calendar is also beneficial because it can be given 
to congregation members informing them of when the next event is coming up.

## Set a Budget

When planning an event, you don't want to spend more money than you have.  Ensure before events 
are planned, pay for the main necessities from your allocated budget first.  This will keep you from 
overspending on supplies 
and getting things that are needed for the event versus things that are wanted.

## Try a Potluck

To cut costs on food, try
[having a potluck](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/8-great-tips-for-planning-the-perfect-potluck).
This is where every member of the congregation brings food that they've bought or cooked themselves to 
the event. This will cover all of the food for the event and reduce the budget that you're using to 
make that purchase.  With everyone bringing food, all you'll need to take care of is eating utensils 
and beverages. It's helpful to have members sign a list with their names and what they intend to bring 
to avoid having too much of a certain dish.

## Spread the Word

A couple of weeks before the event is set to occur, give a weekly announcement during service and 
bible study reminding all members of the event. This will refresh the minds of those that may have 
forgotten about the event entirely. And you may want to remind everyone that signed the list of 
food items not to forget the things they signed up to bring. Using

is just what your church needs to get people talking about the upcoming event.

## Have an Event Plan

When we say have an event plan we mean what is the point of your event? Is it to gather in fellowship 
with church members? Or is the pastor giving a special message to celebrate something specific?
Whatever the reason for the event, ensure that you've got the speaker ready for the event. This will 
alleviate any awkward pauses in the program that could leave event guests confused about what's going on.
