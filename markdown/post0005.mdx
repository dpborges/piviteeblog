## History of the Housewarming Party

The idea of a housewarming party goes way back.

When people heated their homes by wood in fireplaces, the housewarming party idea took on a literal meaning. 
Friends and family would come to the new home with wood, light fires, and warm it for the new inhabitants. 

Some believe a cold and uninhabited house is the perfect place for ghosts to reside. The housewarming party 
meant that the house was warmed and the ghosts and spirits of the house were sent on their way. 

The French host a

which is their version of a house warming party. Traditionally, those who were involved in building or creating 
the house would be invited to celebrate its completion. 

Nowadays, as people achieve homeownership or get a new home, a housewarming party is a great way to celebrate the new digs 
and share your pride in your new home.

Let's take a closer look at things to consider when planning your housewarming party.

## Invitations and Guest List

The first thing to consider is how you want to 
[invite your guests](http://pitchinclub.com/resources/type-of-events).

So, getting your invitations out several weeks in advance is a smart idea for maximum attendance at your 
party.

If you are only inviting old friends, you can be casual and make phone calls to invite friends. You could 
also send emails.

You can also create invitations to send. One fun idea is to send the invitation as part of your change of 
address cards you send to friends and family. 

The written invitation is also nice if you are inviting new neighbors. You can let people know what to 
expect from your party by the invite itself.

## Theme or No Theme

You want to decide if you want to
[have a theme party](https://www.orientaltrading.com/party-supplies/party-tableware/party-theme-packs/party-themes-for-adults-a1-553266-1.fltr)
or not. This will dictate the other decisions you make about your party, like food, decor, and games. 

You could keep it simple and have a backyard barbecue or potluck. You would also really go all out with a theme. 
The theme could be anything from a luau to a fiesta to casino night.

You could also throw a housewarming-related theme party. Maybe you need some help with your house still and want 
to throw a Help Me Out party. You provide food, drinks, and music while your friends pitch in to help.

## Decorations

If you are throwing a theme party, it's pretty easy to come up with theme-related decor. 

If you're not throwing a theme-related party, let your house be the star of the party. You are, 
after all, celebrating that you live there. 

Your friends and family are coming to see your new house, to see you settled and happy. The decor 
comes in the form of you how you are settled into your new home.

You might set up a special station with champagne glasses and have a big toast during the heart of 
the party to celebrate your new house. 

## Food Ideas

Again, food ideas might be guided by a particular theme. 

But you don't have to go crazy or make yourself work for the perfect party food. In fact, this 
is a time when they say many hands make light work applies

Let your friends and family help with the food. People never mind contributing a dish to pass at a 
party. In fact, they feel good about it.

You can even set up 
[an online organizer](https://pitchinclub.com/resources/contribution-list)
so your friends can put down what they plan to bring.

## Games

You will know what's best for your party. Some groups of friends love a party with some
[interactive games](https://www.thespruce.com/housewarming-party-games-4580341).
It helps to break the ice at the party and get people talking, laughing, and having fun. 

You can make your games focused on the housewarming theme. 

You could have a little quiz about the town or area where your new one is located. You might have guests 
participate in a little house scavenger hunt through your new house. 

See how great your friends are with creating words. Have them come up with a list of words made from the 
letters in house. 

Games are an especially fun way to get old and new friends interacting with each other. 

## Tours

You are throwing a party to celebrate your new house. Be prepared to give your guests a tour of your new home. 
 
Depending on the size of your party, you as the hosts might be able to do it, or you might have to have your 
guests take a self-guided tour.
 
It's fun to show guests the before with photos if you have done major renovations too. 
 
As you prepare for the party, focus on clean-up knowing your party guests will likely want to see the house.
