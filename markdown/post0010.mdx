## Choose a Theme and Set a Budget

If you're wondering where to start in the party planning process, begin by determining what the 
[theme of the party](https://www.architecturendesign.net/unique-party-themes/)
will be. This will allow you to make the following decisions according to your theme. Make sure 
your party theme is in line with whatever event you're celebrating while still making it unique and 
personal. You will then want to determine how much you can spend on the party. Setting a budget is a 
great idea because as you gather materials for the party, the cost can really add up. Setting a 
budget will allow you to stay on track without breaking the bank.

## Determine the Date, Venue and Guest List

Once you've established your theme and budget, you can begin thinking of a venue and how many people 
you can afford to invite. Choose a date that will work for a majority of those you wish to invite.
Send out invitations a few weeks out so that you give people time to plan and adjust their schedules. 
To take  [your invitations](https://www.diys.com/creative-event-invitations/)
to the next level, make them personalized which can be a nice touch for a smaller event.

## Stock up on Supplies

Now that you know your theme and venue, you can begin stocking up on supplies and decorations. These 
items are great to buy before, but hold back on buying food until your event is a few days out.
To prepare for the food and drink, plan your party food in advance to make sure the menu will appeal 
to everyone and is enough to feed everyone. If you're using a caterer for your party, planning the food 
and drink in advance can help you sort out who's bringing what.
