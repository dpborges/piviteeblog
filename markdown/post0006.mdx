## Starting Off

To start off, you need to find a team. While you can totally plan an event on your own, it always helps 
to have some extra hands. Where do you start? In terms of general planning, it would be best to get one 
to three other people to help you. This all depends on the size of your group event. Once you have them, they can help call places and help keep track of your money.

If you’re looking at events involving children, any sort of youth group event ideas, then you’ll need 
chaperones at some point in the process. While not necessary right away, it’s a good idea to start trying to 
lock people down so that way you aren’t short when the time comes.

Another good idea to make the process easier and more organized is to look into an event planning aid like

## Determine Your Event

The next step in your group event planning process is to decide what your event actually is. You may want 
to start off with a brainstorming session with your team to come up with some group event ideas. It may 
even help to look at other group events that you’ve organized in the past to help sprout some ideas.

It’s also likely that you already have an idea for an event and that’s perfect. Make sure you share it 
with your team and work out any kinks within. Once you’re good to go, it’s time to move to the next step.

is probably the most important part of the planning process as however much money 
you have available dictates everything you’ll do from this point on. Sit down with your team and bust 
out a notebook.

How big is your event going to be? The budget is ruled by the scope of your event so you need to make sure that 
your event idea is feasible for your financial situation, which leads to the next question.

How are you gaining the funds for this event? Is it coming from your own pockets, are you being given a 
budget, or are you attempting to find sponsors for the event? This is another crucial aspect of your 
budget because as we said earlier: the amount of available money will dictate your event.

## Location, Time, and Day

With your newfound budget, it’s time to solidify your group event. Before you find a location, it’s a good 
idea to determine a time and day first. Go over your teams’ schedules to see when the best day to host 
your group event is
