Throwing a farewell party is the perfect way to commemorate a coworker’s retirement, celebrate your 
parents’ embarking on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation, or say goodbye when your best friends are moving 
across the country. However, party prep of any type takes time, effort, and organizational skills. 
Things can quickly shift from fun to stress as you worry about getting it all done.

Fortunately, farewell party preparation has never been easier, because you don’t have to go it alone. 
[Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com)
is there for you, whether you’re planning a farewell party for a coworker, family member, or favorite 
neighbor. When planning the celebration falls into your hands, you can smile and say, “I got this!”

## Take Control with Tech

Even if you’ve never used a single app in your life, you can easily party plan with the Pitch In Club app. 
First, it’s free. Second, it’s available on your smartphone, tablet, or Chromebook. The Pitch In Club app 
makes it simple to not only plan the party, but to get help from others who can contribute essential items 
or track who’s willing to help with pre-party errands, setup, and even the dreaded cleanup. You’re not 
alone and stuck with every aspect of the event, which also allows you to enjoy the celebration.

## Pick a Venue and Schedule the Event

Sometimes a private home or backyard is the perfect space for a farewell party celebration. Other times, 
the venue needs to be larger, fit a theme, or simply be more business-appropriate. Choosing the right 
venue on your own can be stressful. Working together with others and talking through ideas helps take 
some of the burden off your shoulders. When you’ve chosen the venue, date, and time, you can use the 
Pitch In Club app to schedule your event and move forward with the remaining party plans.

**Pro Tip:** In today’s world where everyone’s 
schedules are packed, make sure your guest(s) of honor are indeed available and able to attend 
their own farewell party.

## Create a Helping Hands and Contribution List

Everyone has commitments and a full schedule, but you can ask for assistance. Most people are happy and 
willing to help, as long as they don’t have to be the one in charge. The Pitch In Club’s Helping Hands 
List makes this easy for both you and them. It’s a shared to-do list or it can be created as a 
[shared “task” list](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/need-a-shared-task-list),
whichever works better for your event and planning style. Through the app, you as the planner make the 
list available to certain attendees and they choose whichever task they’re willing (most comfortable) 
to do for the party. 
[Basic party planning tasks](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/six-tips-for-completing-event-planning-checklist)
include but are not limited to:

- Guest list suggestions
- Contact information for guest invitations
- Theme ideas
- Menu contributions
- Calling for permits (if needed)
- Contacting caterer
- Ordering decorations, flowers, or other items

A Contribution List is equally easy to set up and share. This list focuses not on tasks, but more on items 
that guests can contribute. Think about the items you may need, from decor to basics like extra tables and 
chairs. Maybe you’ve decided a buffet meal works best for the party; consider using the Contribution List 
as a way for guests to list what dish they’ll bring to share.

Ready to get started with the farewell party preparation? With a bit of help and the Pitch In Club, you can 
party plan and host like a pro.
