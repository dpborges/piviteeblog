Event planning is full-on from start to finish. There’s an endless list of things to do and constant

## 1. Create the Checklist Itself

If you haven’t already done it, the very first step is to write up the event planning checklist itself.
This is helpful in different ways. Firstly, it’s crucial to stay organized.
Having a detailed checklist of tasks will help you see exactly what needs doing and by when. Everything should 
feel in more control, and you’re less likely to forget something pivotal in the process!

Secondly, an actual list makes it easier to get people on board. Rather than doing a general recruitment drive, 
you can advertise specific tasks for which people can volunteer. Each individual will have different talents, 
preferences, and availability. With a list of tasks available, it’s possible to pick the ones to which they’re best
suited.

## 2. Speak to Friends and Family

The next step is finding people to put their hands up and volunteer!
This is where it gets interesting. Start by approaching the obvious targets: friends, family members, and work 
colleagues. Let them know about your event and see who might be available to help out. You might be surprised at 
how willing some people are to take on a task. After all, these are your nearest and dearest! They want your event 
to be a success, which means they'll almost certainly help out if they can.

## 3. Think About the Event Itself

Keep in mind that the event itself will play a role in who you ask for help. For instance, let’s imagine that 
you’re organizing an event for your local church. You’re trying to raise money for a new pulpit and have decided
to throw an event to generate some cash. In this case, it’d make total sense to ask the congregation for support 
with setting it up. Speak to folks at the end of each service in the lead up to the event. Put a poster up on any
noticeboards with your contact details. And so on! You could approach the vicar and ask them for help recruiting 
people too. They might be able to mention it in the Sunday service, telling anybody who’s interested in lending 
a hand to get in touch with you. Take the same tack with any event you’re throwing. Leverage the community for 
which you’re running the event to solicit their help.

## 4. Use Social Media

Social media (and Facebook in particular) is another brilliant way to get people involved.
You may well plan to use SM to advertise the event itself. However, it’s just as useful for getting 
volunteers to help plan your event. 
Think about [creating a Facebook group](https://www.howtogeek.com/324111/how-to-create-a-facebook-group/)
for that exact purpose. Give it a  name that relates to the event and set about inviting relevant 
people to join it. As they begin registering their interest, you could post the task list in order 
to seek sign-ups. From there, why not encourage your friends to share the group? The more people 
that see the group, the more who can join it and agree to lend a hand. You can generate masses of 
interest (and volunteers!) with minimal effort.

## 5. Offer an Incentive

Some people will offer to help out of the goodness of their hearts. They want your event to be a success and 
will put themselves at your service as a result. Others, though, might need a bit of incentive! You’re sure to get 
more sign-ups if there’s something in it for would-be volunteers. For instance, you could offer a free ticket to 
the event, or free food and drink on the night if they buy one. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the prize, the more 
sign-ups you’ll get. This is a great way to get people to do the least enjoyable tasks on the list. Better still, 
you don’t have to feel guilty about soliciting peoples’ help in the first place!

## 6. Use the 'Pitch In Club' App

Not to blow our own trumpet, but we’d feel remiss if we didn’t mention the
[Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com).
Our clever event planning/tracking tool is designed for this specific purpose. You can create an event and send 
out invitations for people to ‘pitch in’ somehow. You can provide the option to contribute something to the event 
(such as specific food or drink) or to [lend a hand](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/lend-a-hand-to-a-friend)
instead. The people will get an email with their invite, from where they can decide to pitch in or not. 
They’ll see everything on your event planning checklist and can select how they want to help. You can then 
login and see which of your attendees has decided to do what. It couldn’t be more straightforward to find 
willing contributors.
