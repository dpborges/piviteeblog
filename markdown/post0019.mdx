## Use an Event Management Software

Event management software can transform your event planning business. It’s nearly impossible to keep track of all 
the logistics of an event without some kind of organization software to back you up. This can save you time, make
organization simple, and help you to not lose any of the details. 
There’s a lot of event planning software that 
exists. So, it’s important to do your research to understand what’s available. One of the most popular software 
options on the market is Whova. This will allow you to manage the event with the flexibility to opt-in and out 
of certain functions that the software provides. They have logistic management tools, engagement solutions, and 
conference management. Another project management software that event planners tend to use is Trello. This software
allows you to track progress as you go, and manage separate lists for each facet of the event. It’s also a very 
user-friendly app that you can use to collaborate with team members. 
[There are many online event planning apps](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/easy-party-planning-app),
software, and other systems on the market that will be useful for helping you keep track of your progress. But 
what should you focus on in the process of online event planning?

## Start With the Purpose of Your Event and Invite List

The primary question to focus on here is, why are you holding this event? This is a super important question that
you can’t skip. This will help define your overall goal and help articulate the steps it will take to achieve this.
Having a clear mission behind an event will keep you and your staff on the same page.
You might be fundraising, but is the goal to just raise money or to make a certain amount? Do you also want people 
to leave as subscribers or customers for a business you’re promoting? All of these questions should be answered in
the planning phase. This will then help you define your invite list. If this is an event you’re selling tickets to, 
you’re probably promoting it online and want to attract people. The next phase is event marketing.

## Keep Track of Event Marketing and Logistics

[Email still dominates](https://www.retaildive.com/news/study-47-of-consumers-prefer-email-messages-from-retailers/533367/)
the marketing space, and consumers prefer to receive information through this channel. It’s 
important to set up an email that you will be able to track and send invitations from. Consider using an email 
service like Constant Contact or MailChimp. This will allow you to send emails in bulk. Marketing is just a piece 
of the puzzle when it comes to event planning, and there are many other logistics to keep track of.
Think about things that are less obvious like parking for your attendees. Is this already set up? Should you reach 
ut to a public office for a permit? Then there’s the obvious things like food. You’ll not only need to pick a 
aterer or some type of food supplier, but you’ll also need a menu. Will you have options for dietary restrictions?
Each of these topics should be broken down in your event planning software with deadlines and details. You should 
be able to keep track of each mini-goal along the way. You’ll also want to later report on these goals after the event.

## Plan for Staffing and Engaging Audiences at the Event

As you’re tracking, make sure you also keep track of budget. There will be many more things to pay for once the event is over, 
like the staff. Any professional event will need to be properly staffed. You might choose to work with a staffing company, 
or perhaps you have a staff of your own. You’ll want to start by creating a schedule so that everyone is aware of the times 
they’re expected to be at the event and which jobs they’re performing. Another aspect of the event that the staff might help 
with is actually engaging audience members. Think about doing a giveaway or another activity to thank the guests for supporting 
your event. If you’re hosting the event for a company or organization, you might be able to give away the product you’re promoting.
All of these aspects should be tracked, so that when the event is done, you can go back and determine the success of each element.

## Document the Event and Review After

During the event, be sure to keep a history of each element. If you want to track ticket sales to your event, you can use a 
website like Eventbrite. 
[Sharing your event](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/use-social-media-to-promote-your-event/)
on social media can not only help you gain traction, but can provide you with 
analytics later. Be sure to keep virtual organization of photos, quotes, documents, etc. that happen during the event so you 
can access them later. Consider using a cloud application so other employees can upload it as well. You should also consider 
debriefing with your team after the event. To learn and grow as a successful event planner, it’s beneficial to find out what 
worked and what did not. Collect feedback from your client so you can improve for your next event.
