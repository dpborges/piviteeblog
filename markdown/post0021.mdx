One of the things people say they love about living in small towns is how neighbors are able to easily 
reach out and help each other. Of course, many of these people will also confess that a little neighborliness 
can go a long way, and pretty soon everyone knows everyone’s business, for better or for worse.

There might even be some envy for bigger-city folk who aren’t as physically or geographically connected 
but still, when requested, can find ways to reach out and lend a helping hand to others. 

Luckily, there’s a handy tool that can be useful for anyone from any sized town, thanks to the 
[Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com) an application designed to help people organize events and 
keep track of who is doing what.

The app is certainly useful for event coordinators, party planners, and pro-level organizers who need to keep 
track of big and small duties and make sure volunteers and staff are doing what they’re supposed to. But it 
also can be easily adapted as a way for friends and family who are trying to organize help for someone in 
their circle of support.

Maybe it’s a neighbor who had surgery or a severe injury and isn’t able to cook for a while or get around 
the house well or do yard work. Maybe it’s a family member who had a death in the family and is overwhelmed  
and needs help with organizing the after funeral reception, or an elderly person who needs
someone to check up on them and drop off groceries regularly.

The [Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com) is a perfect way to show your friends that they’ll be 
surrounded with support.

An organizer can invite people to be part of the group and divide up tasks online, such as cooking meals 
for different days or helping with tasks around the house like cleaning. They can help sign up others and 
figure out different times or days that people can provide assistance.

The good thing about the Pitch In Club is that it works great for any group size or location. Maybe members of 
a small town are looking for a better way to keep track of who’s doing what when someone needs help. Or maybe 
members of a larger community would enjoy finding a novel way for everyone to come together to help, even if 
they can’t always get together in person. They can still reach out and perhaps coordinate services like meal 
deliveries from local restaurants or even health care if needed.

The app includes a “Helping Hand” option for those who can directly get involved, and a “Contribution” option 
for those who aren’t able to physically assist but can still offer some support. The
[Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com) can help with your coordination effort and bring friends closer 
together even if they’re physically apart.

If ever you want to organize a group of helping hands, have them join the [Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com).
