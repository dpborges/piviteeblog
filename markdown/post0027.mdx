## Get the Floor Plan in Order

Focus on the 
[floor plan](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/floor-plan-guide-how-to-draw-your-own-floor-plan)
 as a whole.

Start with a digital seating chart or floor plan, if you haven’t yet. Make sure you pinpoint 
certain essential details, such as where electric outlets and bathrooms are located, in 
addition to the overall dimensions of the space. This will help you find the best area to 
lay out your seating plans

## What You’ll Need

Once you find the area where your guests will be, it’s time to plan the seating arrangements. 
First, take a look at your RSVP or guest list. From here, you can plan out the seating 
arrangements.

Be sure to keep best practices in mind, such as accommodating space to capacity. Everyone 
should be able to sit or stand comfortably.

Even though we’re nearing the end of the pandemic, there may still be social distancing 
guidelines you have to follow. Ensure all of your guests are standing or sitting six feet 
apart from others.

You’ll also want to decide what the set-up will look and feel like.

What kind of chairs should you get? Should there be times when your guests will stand? 
If you’re serving food, create a reception layout and ensure you’ll have enough tables.

## Don’t Forget About the Entertainment

Your guests aren’t the only ones to include in your seating plan. For example, will 
there be a band or a DJ? What about your speakers? You may need to adjust your seating 
plan for the entertainment.

For example, you may want to leave your guests seated when you have speakers.

But if you have a band or DJ, allow standing room space in case your guests want to dance. 
Don't forget to accommodate a stage or speaking area for the entertainment.
