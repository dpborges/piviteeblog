## TV Requirements

First things first, you need to make sure your television screen accommodates all of your guests. 
The technology snobs come out during big events like the Super Bowl.

If your screen isn't at least 45 inches, you shouldn't invite more than three people over to 
watch the game. Cramming a lot of people around a small television is not practical.

In addition to the television, you'll want to make sure you have enough space for your 
guests to sit and enjoy the game. You might have to move furniture around or use pull-out chairs to make this happen.

## Decorate for the Party

Not everyone invited to a Super Bowl party will care for decorations. After all, they are there to 
watch the game. But, what's a party without decorations?

There are so many options for Super Bowl decor. Plus, you can get really creative. DIY a football 
field tablecloth, use banners and balloons, and maybe even make your own faux grass coasters.

If you aren't crafty, or just don't have the time, check the dollar store when the event gets closer. 
You can also shop for decorations online.

## Build a Drink Menu

Super Bowl party drinks are essential. Depending on what you and your guests like to drink, you can 
build your own menu with 
[football-themed cocktails](https://www.pastemagazine.com/drink/football-cocktails-/4-football-themed-cocktails-to-drink-on-game-day/) 
or simply buy a keg!

Hiring a mixologist can take your party to an entirely new level. They can bring your drink 
ideas to life. Base your drink menu on team locations.

For example, you can snag local beers drank in the cities of the teams competing. You can also 
choose cocktails based on team colors. A splash of food coloring in drinks is also a festive idea 
you can use for the occasion.

## Make the Snacks

No Super Bowl party is complete without the snacks! Super Bowl party food can be a lot of things. 
Dips, wings, desserts, and appetizers are all common.

Cheesy dips are legendary at tailgates and this is no different during a Super Bowl party. 
Find a creative recipe or ask a friend who is good with snacks to make something for the party.

You can make different foods in the shape of footballs or decorate a cake/cupcakes with a 
football design. If you want something easy, make finger sandwiches and fries for your guests to enjoy.

You can cater food to your Super Bowl party as well. For big parties, use a 
[food serving calculator](https://pitchinclub.com/resources/event-planning-tools)
to make sure you have enough food for everyone.

Don't forget that you have to 
[clean up afterward](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/party-set-up-and-after-party-clean-up). 
If you want to make the cleaning process 
as simple and effective as possible, use paper plates and plastic silverware.

## Play Some Games

While the players are competing on television, you and your guests can compete in adult party games. Of course, you and your guests will want to watch the games and the commercial, so keep these options to a minimum.

Football trivia and bingo are great ideas if your guests aren't really into football and prefer more of the party aspect.

To avoid distraction during the game, place bets with Super Bowl squares before the event starts. Get a 10x10 grid where each square is associated with a number from 0 to 9.

Anyone can pay for the square they want and write their names on it. At the end of each quarter, the square that matches the last number of the team's score wins that round and the money from the square.

Most gamers charge $5 per square, but you and your guests can choose a fair amount for everyone.

## Set up a Photo Booth

Your decorations can also double as a photo area for guests to take pictures. In a corner of the room, 
set up a makeshift photo booth with props and decor. Streamers or tablecloths are perfect for creating 
a backdrop.

Lay out fun hats, football graphics, or glasses so that anyone can dress up with accessories for their 
photo op. If you have a ring light, set it up for the perfect lighting in your custom photo booth.

Another activity you can do before the game with your friends is painting your face. Show your team 
spirit by using face paint to draw on your team's logo or mascot. Your photos will turn out even better!

## Invite Your Guests!

Once you have all of the logistics figured out, you'll want to invite your guests before buying drinks 
and making food. Get a good idea of who is coming and who won't be showing up to the party.

You want people to enjoy themselves even if the game turns out to be a drag. Bring people together 
that will not only watch the game but will also socialize.

You want a diverse crowd, but you don't want anyone too wild, especially if you are hosting 
this at a house or apartment with close proximity to sensitive neighbors.
