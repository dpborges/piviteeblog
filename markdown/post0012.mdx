## 1. It's Important to Make a Budget

Having an event planning budget is crucial to putting together a successful music-focused event. 
Whether you are hosting a local band at a small outdoor concert or planning a massive music festival, 
planning a budget will help you figure out exactly what you'll need for a successful event.

It's a good idea to create a template that you can use for future event planning jobs. Make sure 
that the budget covers everything from the venue to the musicians you book.

If you're still pretty new at planning music events then you probably won't have the budget for 
the bigger musical acts. Looking into some new or local artists will reduce your budget 
significantly and you'll be able to cut out the costs of travel too.

## 2. Set a Timeline

Planning and executing an event takes a lot of work. The success of an event depends on a lot of different 
elements coming together cohesively.

You have to plan for booking the artists, getting the right venue, and renting the necessary equipment. 
All of that takes a lot of time and any setbacks can extend the amount of time needed leading up to the event.

Setting a timeline for what you need to be done, who'll work on each specific element of the event, and how 
much time is needed to complete it is just as important as setting a budget. 
[Setting up a checklist](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/six-tips-for-completing-event-planning-checklist)
of tasks through the Pitch In Club app will help you keep things organized and establish a timeline so that you'll 
know exactly who's helping you with the event and when everything will be completed for the big day.

## 3. Plan According to Your Target Audience

The most important part of planning any music event, whether big or small, is organizing an event to the 
tastes of your audience. The entertainment for guests will vary drastically if your audience is a group of 
toddlers versus people in their 20s and 30s.

It's important to book musicians that will draw the biggest crowd and let everyone who comes out have a great time. 
If you'll be organizing a concert in a suburban town, think about reaching out to some local indie artists. 
Doing some research on social media will help you figure out the popularity of an artist in your area.

## 4. Choose the Perfect Venue

Options for venues are plentiful but choosing the perfect one depends on the type of event you'll be organizing. 
Your audience and your musical act will help you determine the best place to host your event. 

A local, lesser-known band might do well at a local coffee shop or pub. A summer event is a perfect opportunity 
to host an outdoor concert. You'll want the venue to fill up so that everyone can feel great about the show, so choose something appropriate for the talent you've booked.

## 5. Permits and Insurance

While a small church social might not require any specific permits, it's important to do your research as your 
event planning business grows bigger. Getting insurance for your event is important to keep you protected if any 
accidents occur or if equipment gets damaged. Insurance will give you peace of mind that if anything goes wrong, 
any damage will be covered by your policy. 

Another important step for planning your events is making sure you have the right permits. Anytime you host a 
concert in an outdoor space like a city park, you'll need to fill out the right paperwork with the city and pay 
some fees in order to rent out the space for your event. You don't want to make the mistake of skipping out on 
the permits and losing a venue days before your event.

## 6. Finalize All the Event Details

Depending on the bands and artists you'll have performing at your event, you might not have to worry about 
equipment. This is always something that should be at the top of your list. Figuring out what the venue will 
provide, what instruments the artists will bring, and what you might have to purchase or rent yourself ahead 
of time will make the event run as smoothly as possible

While some venues already come with a stage fit for any kind of performance, some spaces require a separate 
stage rental. The stage you get will depend on where you'll be hosting the event and the size of the band and 
equipment they'll need on stage. You want to make sure that you rent from a reliable company to ensure the 
safety of everyone.

## 7. It's All About Promotion

If your event requires ticketing, make sure to price them based on the number of people you expect to come 
with an added cost to cover expenses. Once you've worked out that part, it's time to promote!

[Promoting an event](https://www.visitmonmouthshire.com/events-management/marketing.aspx)
is incredibly important because this is how you'll get people to show up. There are lots of great ways to 
promote your event like posting flyers at frequently visited parts of town, or creating a website for the 
event, and you can't forget about the power of social media.
