Throwing a sports party can get pretty expensive. That's especially true when it's a special occasion,

## 1. Hit the Bulk Retailer

Bulk stores, like Costco or Sam's Club, are amazing resources when you're throwing a sports party. 
If you have a membership, it's a great way to save money on food and supplies for your next party. 
You can get tons of snacks, liquor, and beer for way cheaper than you would be able to at a regular 
grocery store, so it's really a great way to save money.

And, even if you don't have a membership to a bulk retailer, some retailers will allow you to purchase 
alcohol without a membership. So check out your nearest bulk retailer today!

## 2. Keep It Simple

Making sure you don't go overboard is an important part of keeping your costs down when throwing a 
sports party. You don't need a theme, because there already is one, and you don't really need any elaborate 
decorations.

When you're throwing a sports party, the important aspect of the party is the sport, so why take away from 
that with other external things? Keeping it simple is a majorly great way to save money when you're throwing 
a sports party â€” and it's also a great tip for saving money for any other future parties you may throw!

## 3. Create a Budget (And Stick to It!)

One of the most important things you can do to save money on your sports party is to create a budget and 
stick to it as closely as possible. Figure out how much money you can afford to spend on a party and divide 
it up into the different things you'll need to spend money on (food, alcohol, decorations, etcetera).
That way, you'll know in advance specifically how much you'll be able to spend on each aspect of your sports 
party. Budgeting is a very important life skill, so be sure to start practicing with your next sports party!

## 4. Stick to Snacks

You don't need to be serving a four-course meal at a sports party. Create a buffet table of snacks so your 
guests can help themselves! You can also have your party be a snack potluck, to make your occasion even easier. 
But what snacks should you include? Here are some great snacks you may want to throw out at your next sports party:

- Veggies and dip
- Hummus and pita
- Jalapeno poppers
- Cupcakes
- Nachos
- Sliders
- Pigs in a blanket
- Chips and salsa
- Buffalo wings

The above are just some suggestions for snacks you can have at your sports party. There are tons of 
options out there you can try out! Get creative with your array of fabulous snacks, and no one will 
miss not having a full meal at your next awesome sports party.

## 5. Limit the Guest List

One of the simplest ways to save money on your sports party is to keep the guest list small. Keep to people who 
actually like the sport, or who you want to see. You don't need to invite every member of your extended family 
every time you throw a party, after all!

Put a limit on your guest list based on your estimated budget, so you won't have too much leftover food 
or drinks. And, it will be easier to not over or underbuy items with a smaller group of people attending. 
Waste not, want not!

## 6. Stay at Home

You really don't need to rent out a fancy location for your sports party. As long as you have a TV and 
the channel that your sports game plays on, you should be able to happily throw your sports party in the 
privacy of your own home. Just make sure your cable works properly and there's no risk of your power going 
out on that particular day.

If you're super worried about a power or technical issue happening on the night of your big sports party, 
you can borrow or buy a generator as a backup in case of an emergency. But really, there is no reason to 
rent out an expensive location for your sports party, so stay home and save the cash!
