## Planning Your Post-Party Cleanup

When it comes to throwing a great party, planning is everything. This ensures that the whole event goes off 
without a hitch and the post-party cleanup is no exception to this rule!

Because of this, it is a good idea to have a strategy for cleaning your home. This will ensure you do a thorough 
and efficient job. 

To do this you will also need a well-stocked cleaning cupboard. Even if you don't use everything, it's useful to have it. 
The last thing you want when cleaning after a party is to realize you're missing a vital piece of your kit.

Cleaning up can be a big job so make sure to get help from your friends or housemates. That way you can

so things get done quicker.

If you have the budget, you may even want to think about getting in touch with an after-party cleaning business. 
This will be more expensive than doing it yourself, but decent after party cleaning prices can save you a lot of time!

With that in mind, let's take a look at five top tips on the after-party cleaning checklist to make your post-party 
cleanup as smooth as possible.

## 1. Get Air Flowing Through Your Home

After a party, there is almost always debris left lying around and this can make your home smell bad. Getting some 
air flowing through the house or apartment will immediately make it feel fresher.

To do this, open any blinds or curtains in your home and throw the windows and doors open. This will help you to 
see what you're doing and keep your head clear while cleaning.

This is especially important if you are going to use bleach or other strong cleaning products. These can give off fumes that will 
leave you feeling light-headed if you don't use them in a well-ventilated area.

To encourage airflow throughout your home, prop the doors open. This will also make moving between rooms while carrying rubbish 
a lot easier!

## 2. Clear Away Plates and Bottles First

Before you start deep-cleaning your home, you will need to clear the decks. This means getting rid of any rubbish, glasses, 
or plates left lying around. 

It's a good idea to hang a garbage bag in each room and collect your garbage in this. This makes clearing each room a 
lot quicker than going back and forth between the kitchen and whichever room you're cleaning.

Once one garbage bag is full, throw it out straight away. The last thing you need lying around are bags full of rubbish.

You might want to use a tray to clear glasses and plates away from a room quickly. This will help you carry more to the kitchen. 

If you have a dishwasher, stack this straight away and set it going once it's full. That way the washer will take care of one 
job while you get on with the rest!

## 3. Start With the Room Farthest From the Kitchen

Tidying your whole home can feel like a mammoth task, especially if you have to move between rooms. Often you will find 
you have to go back and forth between the kitchen when cleaning.

Because of this, planning which rooms you clean first is very important. The last thing you want is to mess up one 
room while trying to clear another.

This is why it's important to begin with the rooms that are farthest away from the kitchen. That way you won't 
end up walking through rooms that you have already cleaned while carrying rubbish.

When you do start cleaning, work through room by room rather than trying to clean the house all in one go. This 
ensures that you do a thorough job on each room and is a much more satisfying way to clean.

## 4. Spot Treat Any Tricky Stains

Whether you've had a [house warming party](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/how-to-throw-a-housewarming-party)
or a movie night, tricky stains are inevitable at a party. These can come from people's shoes, from spilled drinks, 
or if a guest becomes ill. 

Unfortunately, the chance of anyone dealing with these stains properly on the night is quite low. This can make 
them even more of a challenge to get out!

Because of this, you will need to spot treat any difficult stains as soon as possible. To do this, you will need to 
use specialist stain removal solutions.

Before using these make sure that you read the instructions to ensure you don't damage any of your home's furnishings. 
These will usually need to soak for a while before you clean them off, so apply your stain remover early in the day.

## 5. Do the Floors Last

The floors of your home can take a real battering during a party, particularly if you have carpets. Thankfully, this 
also means that cleaning them will make a big difference to the way your home looks.

However, it is important that you wait until you have cleaned a whole room before tackling the floor. For example, 
only once the rest of the bathroom is clean should you vacuum and mop the floor.

That way you won't mess them up again as you carry on cleaning the rest of your home!

## Don't Let the Post-Party Cleanup Ruin a Great Night

When it comes to the post-party cleanup, the most important thing to do is have a plan of action. 
Sticking to this will ensure you tidy your home or venue up as thoroughly and efficiently as possible.

You're probably wondering how to I get people to pitch in and help out?
The easiest way is to create a [“Helping Hands List”](https://pitchinclub.com/resources/helping-hands)
using a free event planning app like the [Pitch In Club](https://pitchinclub.com)
The list goes out with your invites and people can choose whether they can help or not. 
Of course, they don’t have to, but if you don’t ask, you won’t know . 
This is the easiest way to get the word out. Once people start responding, you can easily track who’s 
coming and who was nice enough to offer a helping hand. That’s it!
