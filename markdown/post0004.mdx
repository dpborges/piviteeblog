This time of year, outdoor events are all the rage. The weather is nice, the air is clean, and it's the 
perfect time to use those beautiful outdoor event venues that are useless during the winter. 

Unfortunately, even the most well-planned outdoor events can go wrong. When you're exposed to the elements, 
not everything is under your control and things can go awry quickly.

Have you considered the possible complications from your next event? 

We're here to help. Before you finalize your event plans, let's talk about a few considerations that you 
should make to keep yourself covered (literally and figuratively). 

Read on for our advice.

## The Weather is King

Your outdoor event relies on the day being nice, clear, and wind-free. You can plan with the weather channel 
and all of the weather sources on the internet, but some things are too unpredictable to plan for. 

Know in advance that even with a 100% chance of clear skies and sunshine,
[you might still get rain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2015/11/27/do-you-or-your-meteorologist-understand-what-40-chance-of-rain-means/#139be7e25d56).

You need to have a few alternative plans and you need to be ready to stay calm should the worst happen. 
Try to stay in the mindset that things will go wrong so that you're pleasantly surprised when they don't or prepared when they do.

You don't need to prepare for a freak August snowstorm, but you should prepare for wind, rain, and the potential 
for extreme temperatures.

## You Should Have a Communication Plan

If things start going haywire during your event, do you have a plan for how to get everyone on the same page?

If everyone is outside and a thunderstorm starts, chaos will erupt in minutes. People may scatter for their cars, 
the indoors, or the closest object that can protect them from the rain.

To prevent this, you need to have a communication plan and you need to ensure that everyone is in on it.

You don't necessarily want to alarm your guests from the beginning that things might go badly. Everyone who 
was in on the planning process, however, should know what the exit strategy is. The people "in the know" should 
be scattered throughout the party to ensure that they have access to everyone. 

Whether you're using communication devices or everything was clearly planned from the beginning, these people need 
to be able to efficiently gather the guests and move them to the secondary location without anyone panicking. 
This is even more effective if the threat is communicated before anything happens.

Once the clouds begin to darken or the temperature hits a certain level you should be on the move.

## You Need a Second Location

That second location that we mentioned just now serves two purposes.

The first one is a getaway spot for when the bad weather hits. As soon as the first raindrop hits a forehead it's 
time to move everything to a safer place.

This also works as a backup location for if the whole day ends up rainy and miserable. The location should be 
nearby so that guests don't have to scurry around wondering where to find the party.                                                        

Some venues have an indoor location attached to the outdoor location that's available for if the party doesn't 
go as planned. If this is the case, you're in luck.

If not, you may need to make do with a local community center or even a home. Planning ahead will give you 
the time to ensure that the change of venue will be possible given your number of guests.

If you don't plan, your guests will have nowhere to go and your party will be over as soon as the bad 
weather starts.

## Get A Tent

Some people resist tents for outdoor events. Maybe you think it will ruin the aesthetic of the party. Maybe 
you just don't think you'll need them

You need to at least have the option available. The coverage from the tent can be the difference between a 
party that's rained out by a summer shower and a party that carries on as if nothing is happening.

An outdoor event tent won't protect you from a natural disaster or even a bad storm. It will, however, shield 
you and your guests from mild weather disturbances and the sun.

Even if you don't think that you'll need a tent, get one anyway. You'll thank yourself later.

## Consider The Dress Code

If you have a dress code for your outdoor event, make sure that it suits the weather and the environment. 

Even if you don't have a specified dress code, make a note of what the venue is like when you're inviting 
people so that they can [make good choices](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/what-to-wear-to-every-outdoor-summer-event)

Places that are sandy or grassy, for example, won't mesh well with high-heeled shoes. An unshaded venue on a hot day will 
call for sunscreen or another kind of skin protection and clothes that are heat-friendly.

## Be Sure You Have Appropriate Equipment

[Planning a party](https://pitchinclub.com/blog/party-planning-101-everything-you-need-to-know)
at an indoor venue feels effortless in comparison to an outdoor one. The electricity is easy to manage. There's likely 
wifi already enabled. You don't have to worry about how far your lights or sound are going to go.

Outdoors, though, you have more complications. You'll need an energy source, wires, and to do a good test run to ensure that 
everything looks and sounds the way that you like. 

You don't just have to worry about your event being too dim or too quiet, you also have to worry about it being too bright 
or too loud. You don't want to upset nearby neighbors.
