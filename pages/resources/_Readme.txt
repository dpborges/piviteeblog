DEPENDENCIES FOR RESOURCE PAGES
> For the How-To pages I needed to install bootstrap 4.1.3
> For EventPlanningTools dependencies see the readme in the eventplanningtools folder 
> Upgraded to next/js 11 to be able to use the next/script <Script> tag.
  After installing I was not able to get the modernizr script to work with the webp classes.
  I left the banner images "as is" (no optimization) on the resource pages.
  See google doc below to see how i was able to add a script tag without without using next/script
